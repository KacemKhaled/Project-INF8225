As mentioned in below sections, there were several instructions that the developers had given that simply did not work for us. We ran into several errors including (but not limited to) dependency issues, version incompatibilities, library deprecations, etc. It was with a great amount of trial and error that we managed to run our experiments.\n",
        "*   We also attempted to change the code to be able to run it on different models and datasets of choice, but this also produced many errors like those mentioned above. There was also the issue of the code being very tightly coupled that it would have required a large amount of refactoring to get it working cleanly.\n",
        "*   Another issue we faced was low performance when running the code. For our experiments we had to choose the parameters with great care to ensure that we were passing realistic values that our hardware would be able to run. Several times, attempting to run some commands would leave execution running for a very long time, with no visible end to the training. In these cases, we would need to manually abort the command and try something else.\n"
